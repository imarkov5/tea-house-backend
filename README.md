# Capstone 3 - Spring Boot REST API

The objective of this capstone is to showcase your skills of building a RESTful API using the Spring Boot framework.
This capstone will tie together all your knowledge acquired throughout the bootcamp.  You will be wiring up your Spring Boot back end to the Front End React App you built in Capstone 1.

## UPER - Problem Solving Framework

In the root of this repository, you will find a a pdf file outlining a methodology to approaching & solving any problem.  The file is called : <code>"Polya's Problem Solving Framework.pdf"</code>  Feel free to research and learn more about the framework online, or stick to the .pdf file as a primary reference.

<i>"The problem is to build a spring boot app"</i>

That definitely is the core assignment, but it is not specific enough.  The above statement does not clearly spell out the exact problems that you as the developer are faced with when tackling this project.  The problem needs to cater towards you **specifically**, where you clearly identify what are the issues, blockers, and challenges that lie ahead of you on the path to reach the end goal.  

Clearly defining the problem is often times the most overlooked and vital step to any complicated project.  Get in the habit of contemplating and documenting what the problem is <code><strong>before</strong></code> you start writing code.  

Step 2 of UPER is <strong>Planning</strong>.  After you have brainstormed and thought about the problems facing you as the developer of this java based game, you should clearly map <strong>each</strong> problem to a clear action item.  These action item steps will go in the plan section of the <code>UPER.md</code> document.  

Realize that even Step 2 - Plan, of the Problem Solving framework can also be done <strong>before</strong> you start coding. 

Document the steps you will be taking for this project in the <code>UPER.md</code> file.  

Also, for step 2 of U<strong>P</strong>ER, you will need to create a DB Schema diagram to set up your Database Schema.  You may start with an Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram first, then use that to derive your DB Schema diagram, or go to the DB Schema diagram directly.  You have several options : 

- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)
- [GenMyModel](https://app.genmymodel.com/)
- [Creately](https://creately.com/diagram-type/class-diagram)
- [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home)
- [dbdesigner.net](https://www.dbdesigner.net/)
etc.

Step 3 and Step 4 of UPER will most likely be an iterative and recursive process.  As you build out your solution, you may come back and update the execution and reflection phases.
